[Nevermined](https://nevermined.io/) is an Open Source solution developed by [Keyko](https://keyko.io/), offering the users the ability to build ecosystems where untrusted parties can share and monetize their digital assets in a way thatâ€™s efficient, secure and privacy preserving. On top of this Nevermined provides the mechanisms to tokenize these digital assets allowing content creators to trade and transfer them in a secure way. It is designed to support the following use cases:

* Art publishing, exhibition, selling. Secondary market
* Collection of objects
* Tokenization of digital and physical assets (real estate, etc.)

Using this baseline, Nevermined will provide to digital assets owners the possibility of leverage them via their utilization in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) scenarios.

In this document we introduce the architecture of Nevermined integrating Aave protocol. This will allow the NFT marketplaces built on Nevermined to augment their existing functionality for their communities allowing loans using NFTs as collateral. This functionality will be offered as a library for these marketplaces, providing new functionalities without lower level integrations with Nevermined or Aave protocols.


## Price discovery

Assets price discovery is a complex topic **out of the scope of this integration**. The focus of this specific integration is to allow NFT owners (ERC-721) to use them as collateral for their loans. The support of ERC-1155 will be evaluated in further phases.

The process of negotiating between Lenders and Borrowers can be done via marketplace (see [nftfi](https://www.nftfi.com/)).
One of the key factors in setting up a credit collateralized by an asset is how to establish that asset price. Depending on the use case there are different options:

* No external interaction. Pure negotiation between lender and borrower. Auctions or additional mechanisms can be used.
* Central or distributed independent authority (notary) setting up independent valuations. In the art sector can be curators, real estate can be a local authority. Notaries can be rewarded and be curated themselves by the network.
* Each non-fungible asset is associated with a token (ERC20 or ERC1155) and its own AMM. Users can stake/add liquidity, working as automatic way to curate the assets.

On top of the price of an asset different credit conditions can be established (repayment period and assets).


## Value

The integration of Aave into Nevermined brings is valuable because:

- Facilitate for NFT owners to put their assets at work. NFT owners can leverage their assets and get liquidity they can use any way they want.
- Facilitate a new business where users can loan to others and get a fee for that (or the collateral if the borrower doesn't refund to the lender)
- Bring more usage to Aave protocol
- Bring more usage to Nevermined


## Integration Details

The integration of Aave require the modification and delivery of the following components:

* The [Nevermined Contracts](https://github.com/nevermined-io/contracts). It will be necessary to extend the Service Agreements to provide a new template and the conditions required to execute a fully end-to-end scenario with the different options.
* [SDK-JS](https://github.com/nevermined-io/sdk-js). Javascript library exposing the Nevermined service agreements for an easier integration


## Architecture

### User Flows

The final goal is to have a fully functional end to end integration, allowing for the users to ask for a credit backed by their NFTs (ERC-721):


#### Setting up the credit

![Setting up the Credit Line](images/nvm-integration-aave-credit-setup.png)

This is the happy path for a end-to-end flow. Steps:

1. The **Borrower** or the **Lender** agree on terms (off-chain via Marketplace for example) for a credit line.
   When this happens any of them can initialize a service agreement on-chain with the credit conditions.   
   This service agreement will be based in a new template: `AaveCreditTemplate`.
   As part of this process a new instance of the `AaveVault` contract will be deployed on-chain. This contract will lock the borrower NFT and the lender ERC20 collateral.
1. The **Borrower** and the **Lender** can review that contract properties are aligned with their initial agreement.   
1. The **Borrower** locks the NFT in the Vault contract instance via NVM **NFTLock** condition
1. The **Lender** locks the payment in the Vault contract instance via the **AaveCollateralDeposit** condition. When this happens NVM call the Aave `approveDelegation` method allowing to borrow from Aave
1. The **Borrower** borrow from NVM via **AaveBorrowCredit** condition
1. After some time the **Borrower** repays the credit through NVM fulfilling the **AaveRepayCredit** condition.
1. The **Borrower** request transfer back the NFT to NVM via **DistributeNFTCollateral** condition


#### What happens when credit is not repaid in time

In the case the credit is not repaid in time, the borrower will get the NFT in return:

![Credit is not repaid in time](images/nvm-integration-aave-repayment.png)

Steps:

1. The **Borrower** try to repay the credit when this is already expired
1. The contracts check via the Aave `getUserAccountData` contract call if the credit already expired or the condition timeout is expired
1. If that is the case, the **AaveRepayCredit** condition will change the state to **aborted**
1. If the **Lender** or the **Borrower** call the **DistributeNFTCollateral** condition and the  **AaveRepayCredit** condition is aborted, the NFT will be transfered to the **Lender** instead of the **Borrower**
1. In addition to this the pending fees will be transfered to Aave
This scenario can happens also if the **Lender** inform about a credit expired via **AaveRepayCredit** condition


### Aave credit template

![Setting up the Credit Line](images/nvm-integration-aave-agreement-flow.png)


NVM will provide a new template integrating the following conditions:

1. Lock NFT - When called by the **Borrower** will lock the ERC-721 NFT into the Aave Vault
1. Aave Collateral Deposit - When called by the **Lender** will lock the credit funds into the Aave Vault and approve the delegation into Aave
1. Aave Borrow Credit - When called by the **Borrower** will borrow the credit funds from Aave Vault
1. Aave Repay Credit - When called by the **Borrower** will repay the credit funds into Aave Vault
1. Transfer NFT - When called by the **Borrower** or the **Lender** will transfer the NFT to one of them depending if credit was repaid in time or not
1. Distribute Payment - Distribute the payments and fees between the users depending of the above conditions
