This SPEC introduces the concept of asset Data Provenance in Nevermined platform based on  the W3C Provenance
specification.

## Motivation

The intention of this document is to discuss how data provenance can be established in a decentralized system,
permitting integrity validation of this provenance information.

The main objectives of this SPEC are:

* Understand what provenance information needs to be tracked
* Specify how the provenance integrity check is stored on-chain
* Identify the actors involved in the publishing and visualization of provenance information
* Detail how to register relationships between source and derived entities
* Detail how to register activities
* Understand how to associate activities with the input and output entities in a workflow
* Validate cryptographically that an entity was generated from a specific input entity in a specific activity


## Decentralized Data Provenance

The W3C PROV specification defines Provenance as:

```
Provenance is information about entities, activities, and people involved in producing a piece of data or thing, which
can be used to form assessments about its quality, reliability or trustworthiness.
```

### W3C PROV Model

The W3C PROV data model includes a core set of types and relations commonly found in provenance tracking for more
specific uses.

In particular, the data model includes both `Type` and `Relation` categories.

`Type` category contains `entity`, `activity` and `agent` which are core components.
`Relations` category defines key relationships between different types of  components, which can be mapped into
specific PROV model relations.

![PROV Mapping](images/prov-mapping.jpg)

#### Provenance Types

Provenance information can be modeled as the interaction between Agents and Entities related via the Activities
between them:

##### Entities

In PROV, physical, digital, conceptual, or other kinds of things are called entities. Examples of such entities are
assets, a web page, a chart, a spellchecker, etc.

##### Agents

An agent takes a role in an activity such that the agent can be assigned some degree of responsibility for the
activity taking place. An agent can be a person, a piece of software, an inanimate object, an organization, or other
entities that may be ascribed responsibility.

##### Activities

Activities are how entities come into existence and how their attributes change to become new entities, often making
use of previously existing  entities to achieve this. They are dynamic aspects of the world, such as
actions, processes, etc. For example, if the second version of document D was generated by a translation from the
first version of the document in another language, then this translation is an activity.

![PROV E-R](https://www.w3.org/TR/2013/REC-prov-o-20130430/diagrams/starting-points.svg)


#### Provenance Relations

##### Generation: Register a new entity generated by an agent

`Generation` is the completion of production of a new entity by an activity.
This entity did not exist before generation and becomes available for usage after this generation.

`Generation`, written `wasGeneratedBy(id; e, a, t, attrs)` in PROV-N (a notation for provenance aimed at human
consumption), has:

* `id`: an optional identifier for a generation;
* `entity`: an identifier (e) for a created entity. In Nevermined a **DID**;
* `activity`: an optional identifier (a) for the activity that creates
the entity. In Nevermined a **DID**;
* `time`: an optional "generation time" (t), the time at which the
entity was completely created;
* `attributes`: an optional set (attrs) of attribute-value pairs
representing additional information about this generation.

While each of `id`, `activity`, `time`, and `attributes` are optional, at least one of them must be present.

**PROV** uses qualified names to identify things for data provenance, which is essentially a shortened representation
of a URI in the form of `prefix:localpart`.

Example:

```text
  wasGeneratedBy(did:nv:e1, did:nv:a1, 2019-10-26T21:32:52)
  wasGeneratedBy(did:nv:e2, did:nv:a1, 2019-10-26T10:00:00)
```

The above example shows the existence of two generations (with
respective times 2019-10-26T21:32:52 and 2001-10-26T10:00:00), at which
new entities, identified by `did:nv:e1` and `did:nv:e2`, were created
by an activity, identified by `did:nv:a1`.


##### Derivation: register relationship between source and derived entities

`Derivation` is a transformation of an entity into another, an update of
 an entity resulting in a new one, or the construction of a new entity
 based on a pre-existing entity.


A `derivation`, written `wasDerivedFrom(id; e2, e1, a, g2, u1, attrs)`
in PROV-N, has:

* `id`: an optional identifier for a derivation;
* `generatedEntity`: the identifier (e2) of the **derived entity**
generated by the derivation. In Nevermined a **DID**;
* `usedEntity`: the identifier (e1) of the **source entity** used by the
 derivation. In Nevermined a **DID**;
* `activity`: an optional identifier (a) for the activity using and
generating the above entities. In Nevermined a **DID**;
* `generation`: an optional identifier (g2) for the generation involving
 the generated entity (e2) and activity (a). In Nevermined a **DID**;
* `usage`: an optional identifier (u1) for the usage involving the used
entity (e1) and activity (a). In Nevermined a **DID**;
* `attributes`: an optional set (attrs) of attribute-value pairs
representing additional information about this derivation.


The following descriptions are about derivations between `did:nv:e1` and
`did:nv:e2`, but no information is provided as to the identity of the
activity (and usage and generation) underpinning the derivation.
In the second line, a type attribute is also provided.

```
wasDerivedFrom(did:nv:e2, did:nv:e1)
wasDerivedFrom(did:nv:e2, did:nv:e1, [ prov:type="physical transform" ])
```

The following description expresses that activity `did:nv:a`, using the
entity `did:nv:e1` according to usage `did:nv:01`, derived the entity
`did:nv:e2` and generated it according to generation `did:nv:02`.
It is followed by descriptions for generation `did:nv:02` and usage `did:nv:01`.

```
wasDerivedFrom(did:nv:e2, did:nv:e1, did:nv:a, did:nv:02, did:nv:01)
wasGeneratedBy(did:nv:02; did:nv:e2, did:nv:a, -)
used(did:nv:01; did:nv:a, did:nv:e1, -)
```

With such a comprehensive description of derivation, a program that analyzes provenance can identify the activity
underpinning the derivation, it can identify how the preceding entity `did:nv:e1` was used by the activity
(e.g. for instance, which argument it was passed, if the activity is the result of a function invocation), and which
output the derived entity `did:nv:e2` was obtained from (say, for a function returning multiple results).

#### Activity: Register activities

An `activity` is something that occurs over a period of time and acts upon or with entities; it may include consuming,
processing, transforming, modifying, relocating, using, or generating entities.

An `activity`, written `activity(id, st, et, [attr1=val1, ...])` in  PROV-N, has:

* `id`: an identifier for an activity;
* `startTime`: an optional time (st) for the start of the activity;
* `endTime`: an optional time (et) for the end of the activity;
* `attributes`: an optional set of attribute-value pairs ((attr1, val1), ...) representing additional information
about this activity.

Example:

```
activity(a1, 2011-11-16T16:05:00, 2011-11-16T16:06:00,
        [ ex:host="server.example.org", prov:type='ex:edit' ])
```

The above example shows the existence of an activity with identifier `a1`, `start time 2011-11-16T16:05:00`, and
`end time 2011-11-16T16:06:00`,  running on `host server.example.org`, and of `type edit`.

The activities could be mapped to the Nevermined [Workflows](architecture/specs/compute/README.md#workflows).



## Integration of Data Provenance in Nevermined

### Assets Provenance Modeling

To support the inclusion of the PROV information into a W3C Decentralized Document (DDO), the PROV modeling of Assets
uses the [W3C PROV-JSON spec](https://www.w3.org/Submission/prov-json).  

From the PROV-JSON spec, each type of PROV assertion (e.g. entity, activity, generation, usage, etc.) is organised into
a separate property with the same name in the top-level object as follows.

```json
{
    "entity": { // Map of entities by entities' IDs
    },
    "activity": { // Map of activities by IDs
    },
    "agent": { // Map of agents by IDs
    },
    <relationName>: { // A map of relations of type relationName by their IDs
    }
}
```

Each property itself is a JSON object, which is a map-like structure to hold all the PROV-JSON representation of
assertions of the same type indexed by their identifiers. Hence, a PROV-JSON document is an indexed representation of a
PROV document, in which PROV assertions are indexed by their types and by their identifiers.

#### Elements

This section describes the JSON representations for all PROV elements: entity, activity, and agent.

#### Entity

Each entity is represented as a property in the entity object, identified by the entity's ID. The property's value
itself is an object structure containing the entity's attribute-values pairs.

```json
...

"entity": {
    "did:nv:1234": {
        "prov:type": "dataset",
        "ex:version": "5"
    }
},
...

```


##### Agent

```json
...

"agent": {
    "did:nv:abcd": {
        "prov:type": {
            "$": "prov:Person",
            "type": "xsd:QName"
        }
    }
    ...
},
...

```

##### Activity

```json
...
"activity": {
    "did:nv:a1": {
        "prov:startTime": "2011-11-16T16:05:00",
        "prov:endTime": "2011-11-16T16:06:00",
        "ehost": "server.example.org",
        "prov:type": {
            "$": "ex:edit",
            "type": "xsd:QName"
        }
    }
},
...

```

#### Relations

In general, a PROV relation expression follows the following construct:

`relationExpression := relationName (relationID; identifier1, identifier2, [additionalProperties])`

where identifier1 and identifier2 are identifiers to PROV elements. Relations are grouped by relationName in a
PROV-JSON structure.

```json

{
    ...
    "wasGeneratedBy": {
        "8989": {
            "prov:entity": "did:nv:1234",
            "prov:activity": "did:nv:a1",
            "prov:time": "2001-10-26T21:32:52",
            "ex:port": "p1"
        },
        "8990": {
            "prov:entity": "did:nv:1235",
            "prov:activity": "did:nv:a1",
            "prov:time": "2001-10-26T10:00:00",
            "ex:port": "p1"
        },
    },
    ...
}

```

Different types of relations are:

* wasGeneratedBy
* used
* wasDerivedFrom
* wasInformedBy
* wasStartedBy
* wasEndedBy
* wasInvalidatedBy
* wasAttributedTo
* wasAssociatedWith
* actedOnBehalfOf
* wasInfluencedBy
* specializationOf
* alternateOf
* hadMember

All the provenance information will be stored as part of the DDO as an independent service:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://w3id.org/future-method/v1",
  "authentication": [{}],
  "created": "2019-02-08T08:13:49Z",
  "id": "did:nv:0000",
  "proof": {},
  "publicKey": [{}],
  "service": [{
		"index": "0",
		"type": "metadata",
		"serviceEndpoint": "https://service/api/v1/metadata/assets/ddo/did:nv:0ebed8226ada17fde24b6bf2b95d27f8f05fcce09139ff5cec31f6d81a7cd2ea",
		"attributes": {
			"main": {},
			"additional": {},
			"curation": {}
		}
	}, {
		"index": "1",
		"type": "provenance",
		"serviceEndpoint": "https://service/api/v1/provenance/assets/ddo/did:nv:0ebed8226ada17fde24b6bf2b95d27f8f05fcce09139ff5cec31f6d81a7cd2ea",
		"attributes": {
			"main": {
				"entity": {
					"did:nv:1234": {
						"ex:version": "5",
						"prov:type": "dataset"
					}
				},
				"activity": {
					"ex:edit1": {
						"prov:type": "edit"
					}
				},

				"comment": {
					"ex:comment1": {
						"prov:type": "comment"
					}
				},

				"wasGeneratedBy": {
					"did:nv:abcd": {
						"prov:activity": "ex:edit1",
						"prov:entity": "did:nv:1234"
					}
				},

				"wasAssociatedWith": {
					"did:nv:eeff": {
						"prov:activity": "ex:comment1",
						"prov:entity": "did:nv:1234"
					}
				},

				"agent": {
					"did:nv:abcd": {
						"prov:type": {
							"$": "prov:Person",
							"type": "xsd:QName"
						}
					},
					"did:nv:eeff": {
						"prov:type": {
							"$": "prov:Person",
							"type": "xsd:QName"
						}
					}
				}
			}
		}
	}]
}
```

In the above example you can see a DDO including a **Provenance** service. It details how the entity `did:nv:1234`
**wasGeneratedBy** `did:nv:abcd` the activity of `edit1` by the agent `did:nv:abcd` and **wasAssociatedWith** the
activity of `comment1` by the agent `did:nv:eeff`.

### Provenance integrity

To guarantee the integrity of the provenance information, the complete `provenance` JSON object inside of the
`Provenance` service is serialized and hashed using `keccak256`.

This generated checksum will be stored as part of the Provenance service in the `checksum` attribute.

Additionally, this checksum can be registered on-chain to prevent the tampering of provenance information. Also this
checksum can be used as part of the DID computation.

#### How to compute the provenance checksum

To generate the checksum in a way that can be computed and verified multiple times, the JSON object must be serialized
using the following rules:

* All the \n, \t, \r characters must be removed
* All the whitespaces out of the Json entities names or values must be removed
* The Json document and all the nested objects must be sort alphabetically

This must generate a compact JSON object of only one line that can be hashed and the verification of the hash can be
re-calculated.
